  abstract  = {Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced sensors and capabilities, yet engaging human drivers effectively in hazard perception remains a challenging research area. This paper investigates the potential of mixed reality (MR) to enhance driver warning systems. The study examines the impact of attention-shifting methods, including visual cues, audio cues, and a combination of both, on drivers’ hazard perception. A preliminary study involving six participants was conducted, and the NASA-TLX analysis did not yield significant differences. However, through the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we unveil distinct brain activation patterns associated with visual and sound cues. Further research with larger sample sizes and diverse driving scenarios is required to validate and expand upon these preliminary results.},

  abstract  = {Alice in Gravityland is a VR adventure exploring three gravity experiences with novel, around-the-head vibrotactile feedback using illusory tactile motion. Players are able to 1) change the direction of gravity, 2) navigate through zero gravity, and 3) defy gravity as they walk on walls. The haptic feedback helps improve players’ sense of directionality to improve immersion when experiencing gravity events. Inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865), the game invites players to alter gravity to solve puzzles and experience gravity in a unique way through this multi-sensory VR adventure.},

  abstract  = {Visually induced motion sickness in VR, or cybersickness, is a major barrier to VR adoption. We present InertiaVibe, a low-fidelity approach to simulate the experience of lateral inertial forces using headset-integrated vibration motors. Specifically, we use 4 vibration motors positioned at both sides of the forehead and the occipital bone, and vibrate the pair of motors in the direction of the inertia force during lateral acceleration, deceleration, and turning. To first evaluate how users think about the vibrotactile feedback in different scenarios, we conducted a pilot study with 12 participants. Results show that their opinions on the vibration were positive. Most users reported improvement of both realism and immersion, and they generally felt less discomfort.},

%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
