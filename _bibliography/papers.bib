  abstract  = {Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced sensors and capabilities, yet engaging human drivers effectively in hazard perception remains a challenging research area. This paper investigates the potential of mixed reality (MR) to enhance driver warning systems. The study examines the impact of attention-shifting methods, including visual cues, audio cues, and a combination of both, on drivers’ hazard perception. A preliminary study involving six participants was conducted, and the NASA-TLX analysis did not yield significant differences. However, through the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we unveil distinct brain activation patterns associated with visual and sound cues. Further research with larger sample sizes and diverse driving scenarios is required to validate and expand upon these preliminary results.},

  abstract   = {We present DrivingVibe, which explores vibrotactile feedback designs around the head to enhance VR driving motion experiences. We propose two approaches that use a 360-degree vibrotactile headband: 1) mirroring and 2) 3D inertia-based. The mirroring approach extends the vibrotactile patterns of handheld controllers to actuate the entire headband uniformly. The 3D inertia-based approach uses the acceleration telemetry data that driving games/simulators export to motion platforms to generate directional vibration patterns, including: i) centrifugal forces, ii) horizontal acceleration/deceleration, and iii) vertical motion due to rough terrain. The two approaches are complementary as the mirroring approach supports all driving games because it does not require telemetry data, while the 3D inertia-based approach provides higher feedback fidelity for games that provide such data. We conducted a 24-person user experience evaluation in both passive passenger mode and active driving mode. Study results showed that both DrivingVibe designs significantly improved realism, immersion, and enjoyment (p&lt;.01) with large effect sizes for the VR driving experiences. For overall preference, 88\% (21/24) of participants preferred DrivingVibe, with a 2:1 preference for 3D inertia-based vs. mirroring designs (14 vs. 7 participants). For immersion and enjoyment, 96\% (23/24) of participants preferred DrivingVibe, with nearly a 3:1 preference (17 vs. 6 participants) for the 3D inertia-based design.},

  abstract  = {Alice in Gravityland is a VR adventure exploring three gravity experiences with novel, around-the-head vibrotactile feedback using illusory tactile motion. Players are able to 1) change the direction of gravity, 2) navigate through zero gravity, and 3) defy gravity as they walk on walls. The haptic feedback helps improve players’ sense of directionality to improve immersion when experiencing gravity events. Inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865), the game invites players to alter gravity to solve puzzles and experience gravity in a unique way through this multi-sensory VR adventure.},

  abstract   = {Visually induced motion sickness in VR, or cybersickness, is a major barrier to VR adoption. We present InertiaVibe, a low-fidelity approach to simulate the experience of lateral inertial forces using headset-integrated vibration motors. Specifically, we use 4 vibration motors positioned at both sides of the forehead and the occipital bone, and vibrate the pair of motors in the direction of the inertia force during lateral acceleration, deceleration, and turning. To first evaluate how users think about the vibrotactile feedback in different scenarios, we conducted a pilot study with 12 participants. Results show that their opinions on the vibration were positive. Most users reported improvement of both realism and immersion, and they generally felt less discomfort.},

  abstract  = { Considered to be an emerging topic in tourism research, traveling to familiar places benefits both the travelers and destinations. However, the current development of familiar tourism is severely affected by the epidemic. Recognizing the potential of virtual reality (VR), this research aims to explore VR’s relevance in the application of visiting familiar places and the empirical features of VR beyond on-site familiar tourism. We first reviewed the literature and developed an experience framework. Secondly, we conducted an exploratory activity in which participants (N = 16) used Google Earth VR to travel to their familiar places with two conditions (free exploration and task-oriented travel). In the activity, we employed think-aloud protocols, a scale, and semi-structured interviews. With our framework, we categorized findings into five dimensions and indicated the similarities and differences between familiar tourism in VR and that in actual places. Particularly, three empirical features (the sense of distance, multi-view space, and montage time) were recognized and formed VR’s opportunity to outperform on-site travel. We conclude by discussing the impacts of VR on familiar tourism and providing implications, including designing the timeline, sounds, tasks, and virtual guides. These suggestions inspire designers to acknowledge VR limitations and identify directions for future tourism applications. As a beginning of empirical investigation on VR familiar tourism, this study opens up a new field of discussion around VR tourism experience. We invite the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community to collectively probe into the VR experience and design of visiting familiar places. Efforts in this area will stretch beyond the current understandings of various forms of tourism and contribute to crafting rich travel experience by immersive technologies. },
